            <p>
                Like all great love stories, Ashley and Carl met in college. Their story began in the summer of 2018 at the University of Illinois,  where they were campus tour guides and Ashley was Carl’s boss . . .
            </p>
            <p>
                After weekly hangouts at their favorite campus bar and many campus admissions events, Ashley and Carl began dating in the beginning of 2020. Since then, they’ve tackled the COVID-19 lockdown, long-distance dating during graduate school, and moving across the country together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They now live in Atlanta, Georgia, with their three food-named pets—Bao Bun and Dumpling the cats and Noodle the dog. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When people ask what’s new and what’s next, they have no answer. They just take life one step at a time, knowing they have each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can’t wait to have all our friends and family together for this special day on October 11, 2025!

            <p> We will be holding our wedding reception at the Trolley Barn in Atlanta, Georgia, in the historical Inman Park neighborhood. The building dates back to the late 1800s, when it housed offices and maintenance for the United States’ first electric streetcar system. Since then, the building has exchanged hands, and now the Inman Park Historical Association owns and maintains it as a crucial landmark in our neighborhood.

            <p>
                Below, we’ve curated a list of nearby hotels where you can stay during the wedding weekend! Feel free to explore outside of these options for what works within your budget. We recommend staying within 10 miles of the venue—the further out you go, the more unpredictable traffic can be.
